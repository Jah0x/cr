# Product vision: Retail Backoffice + POS

## Purpose
A web system for a small retail shop:
- manage catalog (categories/brands/lines), photos, prices
- manage purchases (invoices/receipts), stock
- POS sales with discounts (percent or amount)
- payments tracking (cash/card, terminal integration optional)
- accounting-style analytics: turnover, COGS, gross profit, margin
- cost methods: Last Purchase / Weighted Average / FIFO

## Interfaces
- Web Admin (owner/manager): catalog, purchases, pricing, analytics, users/roles
- Web POS (cashier): fast tile-based selling by categories, search, discounts, payment, receipt
